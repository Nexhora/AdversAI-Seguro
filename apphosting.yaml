# The client-side Firebase config is now hardcoded in src/lib/firebase.ts
# to prevent build-time issues with environment variables.
# The GOOGLE_API_KEY secret is automatically made available to the build
# environment by App Hosting if permissions are granted. We no longer need
# to pass Firebase-related secrets or GOOGLE_API_KEY here.
